# üß† APB Protocol Implementation using FSM (Finite State Machine)

This project presents a complete Verilog-based design of the **AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol**, implemented using a clearly structured Finite State Machine (FSM). The APB protocol is widely used in SoCs (System-on-Chip) for interfacing low-power peripherals.

## üìò Project Objective

To implement the APB protocol in Verilog HDL using an FSM-based approach that handles both read and write operations, showcasing the protocol‚Äôs two-phase transfer mechanism (`SETUP` and `ACCESS`) along with proper handshaking using the `PREADY` signal.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è FSM Design

The core of the APB protocol implementation is a **3-state FSM** that controls signal transitions during each APB transaction.

### üßæ States Description:
- **IDLE**: The bus is inactive; waiting for a valid transfer.
- **SETUP**: Master asserts `PSEL` with address and control signals.
- **ACCESS**: Master asserts `PENABLE` and waits for `PREADY` from slave to complete transfer.

### üîÅ FSM State Diagram:

The state machine transitions based on `PSEL`, `PENABLE`, `PWRITE`, and `PREADY`, ensuring correct timing behavior and protocol compliance.

## üìà Waveform Diagram

This waveform shows a **write operation** where data is transferred from master to slave. The signals involved include `PCLK`, `PRESETn`, `PSEL`, `PWRITE`, `PENABLE`, `PADDR`, `PWDATA`, and `PREADY`.

**Highlights:**
- `PSEL` and address/data are asserted in SETUP phase.
- `PENABLE` is asserted in ACCESS phase.
- `PREADY` determines when to complete the transfer and move back to IDLE or SETUP for next transaction.
